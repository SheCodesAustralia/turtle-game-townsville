    <description>Welcome St Pat‚Äôs gals! We‚Äôre so excited to have you here.&#xA;Today we will be building a Python program using the Turtle module to simulate a mini ‚Äúrescue mission‚Äù on the Great Barrier Reef.&#xA;Your turtle will be an environmental warrior, navigating through obstacles to collect rubbish in the ocean and avoid coral damage.&#xA;We‚Äôll cover concepts like loops, functions, conditionals, and x-y coordinates, all while building a playable game.</description>

      <description>Meet Python: Your New Coding Sidekick üêç&#xA;We think Python is as friendly as your favourite teacher, as flexible as a yoga instructor, and as powerful as a wizard.&#xA;What Makes Python So Sweet?&#xA;Super Easy to Read Python speaks almost plain English. No weird symbols, or confusing squiggles. Human readability is what makes this language a nice starting place. But don‚Äôt worry if it looks confusing to start - any language takes some practice.</description>
