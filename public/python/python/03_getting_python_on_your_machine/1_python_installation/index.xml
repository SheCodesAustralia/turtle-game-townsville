    <description>We need Python before we can start. If you don’t have Python installed yet, start by installing Python. Ideally we would like you to install the latest version of Python, however if you already have an earlier version installed that should work too! At a minimum, this tutorial requires Python 3.5.&#xA;Check your version of Python We’re going to perform a simple experiment to check whether Python is already installed, and if it is, what version is installed.</description>
