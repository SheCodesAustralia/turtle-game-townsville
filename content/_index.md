Welcome St Pat's gals! We're so excited to have you here. 

Today we will be building a Python program using the Turtle module to simulate a mini “rescue mission” on the Great Barrier Reef. 

Your turtle will be an environmental warrior, navigating through obstacles to collect rubbish in the ocean and avoid coral damage.

We’ll cover concepts like loops, functions, conditionals, and x-y coordinates, all while building a playable game.

When we're done, feel free to come back to this tutorial to play with your friends and family, or keep building new features for your turtle - we've got some tips at the end.
